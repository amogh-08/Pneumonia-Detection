### Novelty

- As the first countries explore deconfinement strategies, the death toll of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) keeps rising. The increased strain caused by the pandemic on healthcare systems worldwide has prompted many physicians to resort to new strategies and technologies.Chest X-rays (CXRs) provide a non-invasive (potentially bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease.
- Our modelâ€™s ability to gauge the severity of COVID-19 lung infections could be used for escalation or de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU.
- Medical imaging research is currently embracing the automatic detection techniques used in computer vision. Over the past decade, Deep Learning techniques have shown an enormous breakthrough in the field of medical diagnostics.
